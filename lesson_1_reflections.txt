How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped me to see what the old version of file had when compared with 
    the new version of file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It helps me save time by just looking at the history of changes at a place
    and helps me by not manually not going through the files versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It helps the user choose when to save a commit as per his logical change,
    instead of the VCS doing it automatically for the user.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It helps user to not manually go check every file for the changes, instead 
    helps the user by showing the changes at a time in a single place.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log helps to view the commit history of the repository where as 
    Git diff followed by the ids of commit helps in viewing the changes in
    the two different commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It helps by keeping the version of the file which had the bug in order it 
    to break.We can confidently go back to the previous commits and look 
    for the bug using git log and git diff.It helps to explore by making the changes knowing that u can look for previous version anytime .

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    We can use Git for version controlling of the files.
